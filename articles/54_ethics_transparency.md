# Why Ethics and Transparency Matter in AI Trading 🤝📑

AI trading often has a reputation for being a "Black Box" that manipulates markets. But as builders, we have a responsibility to design for **Transparency** and **Accountability**.

In **AiTrader**, ethics isn't an afterthought; it’s an architectural pillar.

### 📑 Explainable AI (XAI)
If our system makes an aggressive move, we need to be able to explain *why*. 
- **The Audit Agent** records every rationale.
- **The Sanity Agent** ensures the move aligns with documented "Trading Principles."
- We never trade "Black Box" signals that don't have a human-auditable logic trail.

### 🤝 Responsible Scaling
We don't use the system to "Front-run" retail or manipulate small-cap tokens. Our **Sanity Agent** automatically blocks low-liquidity assets where our own orders could cause artificial price distortion.

### 💡 The Outcome
A system that trades with integrity. By building for transparency, we earn the trust of the community and ensure that our "Algorithmic Edge" doesn't come at the expense of market health.

**Build for profit, but architect for trust.**
