# Whale Watching 101: Identifying Accumulation with On-Balance Volume (OBV) 🐋🌊

Price moves because of **Volume**. If you only look at the candle color, you're missing the true narrative of the market. 

In **AiTrader**, we use the **Volume Agent** to track the "Institutional Footprint" using OBV.

### 🌊 The "Leading" Indicator
On-Balance Volume is a simple but powerful cumulative indicator:
- If Price is ranging but **OBV is trending up**, it indicates **Accumulation**. The whales are buying without pushing the price up too fast (yet).
- If Price makes a New High but **OBV fails to follow**, it indicates **Distribution**. The "Pump" is backed by thin volume and is likely a fakeout.

### 🤖 Automated Divergence Hunting
Our agent doesn't just "look" at a line. It calculates the **OBV Regression Slope** across multiple timeframes. If the 4-hour OBV slope is positive while the 15-minute price slope is negative, the system flags a "High-Probability Accumulation Zone."

### 💡 The Outcome
We stop chasing "Candle FOMO" and start trading the underlying momentum of the capital. 

**Follow the volume, and the price will eventually follow you.**
