# Beyond Static Limits: Mathematical Diversification in AI Portfolios 📊📐

Most traders think "Diversification" just means buying more coins. In quantitative trading, that’s just "Correlation Risk."

In **AiTrader**, we use **Mathematical Diversification** to ensure our portfolio is robust against sector failures.

### 📐 Logic-Based Limits
Our Risk Agent enforces strict, code-driven diversification rules:
1. **Asset Correlation**: The system monitors the correlation matrix of the current portfolio. If we already have 3 "High Correlation" DeFi positions, the system automatically blocks a 4th, even if the signal is 10/10.
2. **Sector Caps**: We cap exposure to specific narratives (e.g., L1s, AI Coins, Gaming tokens). This prevents a single sector-wide "Black Swan" event from wrecking the whole account.
3. **Volatility Weighting**: We adjust position sizes so that every position contributes the same amount of "Risk Dollars" to the total portfolio, mathematically balancing the "Heat."

### 🤖 Why It Wins
The AI doesn't get "greedy" or "hyped" for a specific coin. It follows the mathematical constraints assigned to it by the Governor. This ensures that the portfolio remains a balanced, diversified machine.

**True diversification is mathematical, not emotional.**
