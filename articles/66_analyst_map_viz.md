# Visualizing the "Shared Mental Model": The Analyst’s Decision Map 📊👁️

In a Multi-Agent System (MAS), the biggest challenge is **Cohesion**. How do you ensure that 20 different workers are all talking about the same reality?

In **AiTrader**, we use the **Shared Analysis Object**—and we visualize it on a **Decision Map**.

### 👁️ The Window into the Hive-Mind
Our dashboard doesn't just show a price line. It shows a cluster of "Expert Opinions":
- **The Heatmap**: Which symbols are currently "Hot" according to the Consensus Agent?
- **The Rationale Stream**: A real-time terminal feed of the *thinking* behind the trades (e.g., "The Fibonacci agent just confirmed a 61.8% overlap on ETH").
- **The Bias Polar Map**: A radar chart showing the delta between "Technical Bias" (math) and "Sentiment Bias" (voice/news).

### 🤖 Why Visibility Matters
Trust. When you see exactly *why* the system is choosing BTC over SOL, you stop treating it like a "Black Box" and start treating it like a professional tool. 

**Observability is the bridge to autonomy.**
