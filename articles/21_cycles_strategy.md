# The Rhythm of the Market: Finding Alpha in Cycles ⏳💫

Markets aren't random; they have a pulse. There’s a periodicity to how volatility expands and contracts, and how price trends and ranges.

In **AiTrader**, we use the **Cycles Strategy Agent** to identify these hidden rhythms.

### ⏳ Time is the Missing Dimension
Most traders only look at price. We look at **Time-Price alignment**. 
- Is it the start of a new Weekly cycle?
- Are we hitting a "Time Pivot" where a trend usually exhausts?
- Is there a recurring pattern in the 4-hour cycle that we can exploit?

### 🤖 Periodicity Detection
The Cycles Agent uses mathematical transforms (like Fourier or Wavelet analysis) to find repeating patterns in the data:
1. **Dominant Cycle Identification**: It finds the strongest "heartbeat" of the asset (e.g., a 24-period cycle).
2. **Phase Analysis**: It determines where we are in that cycle. Are we at the "Peak" (exhaustion) or the "Trough" (accumulation)?
3. **Synthesis**: It combines cycle data with traditional structural bias to find "Time-Confluence" setups.

### 💡 Why It Matters
When you know a trend typically lasts 15 bars on your timeframe, you don't get greedy at bar 14. You start looking for the exit. It adds a "Predictive" layer to our reactive models.

**The market is a wave. Learn to surf the cycles.**

**Do you trade based on time (e.g., "Monday Low" or "London Open"), or just price action?**
