# Identifying the "Smart Money": How to Spot Institutional Footprints 🐋🔍

Institutional traders don't use simple indicators. They move in "Blocks" and leave specific, high-volume footprints in the market.

In **AiTrader**, we track these moves using a combination of **Volume Profile** and **Order Flow analysis**.

### 🔍 Spotting the Accumulation
How do you know when a "Whale" is loading up? 
1. **The Absorption**: Price is ranging, but the **Value Areas Agent** shows massive volume clustering at the POC (Point of Control). The smart money is "absorbing" the paper-hands sell-offs.
2. **The OBV Divergence**: Price is making a lower low, but On-Balance Volume is making a higher low. This is the "Fuel" for the next leg up.
3. **The Swing Failure (SFP)**: A quick dip below a major structural level to grab liquidity before an aggressive reversal.

### 🤖 The Whale-Watching Agent
Our system monitors these footprints across 1,000+ symbols. When it sees an absorption pattern forming on the 4-hour timeframe, it alerts the **Governor Agent** to prepare for a "Directional Shift."
