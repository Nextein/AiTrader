# Centaurs, Not Robots: The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Model 🏇🤖

The future of trading isn't "Humans vs. Machines." It’s "Humans + Machines."

In **AiTrader**, we don't believe in "set and forget." We believe in **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** architecture—combining the raw speed of AI with the strategic intuition of a human expert.

### 🏇 The Machine’s Strength: Outreach & Discipline
The AI can scan 1,000 assets, analyze multi-timeframe confluence, and calculate risk for every single one in seconds. It never sleeps, never gets tilted, and never skips a rule.

### 🧠 The Human’s Strength: Context & Nuance
A human knows when a sudden "Black Swan" news event makes the last 4 hours of technical analysis irrelevant. A human knows that an exchange going down might cause artificial volatility that the AI might interpret as a "signal."

### 🤝 How They Work Together in AiTrader:
1. **Approval Mode**: For high-risk or large trades, the AI prepares everything (the setup, the rationale, the risk) and sends a "Request for Approval." The human just clicks "Yes" or "No."
2. **Signal Injection**: An expert can "nudge" the system by injecting a high-priority bias based on fundamentals (e.g., "Macro is bullish on BTC"). The system then handles the *technical* execution of that bias.
3. **The Kill Switch**: Humans maintain ultimate authority. With one command, we can halt specific strategies or the entire system globally.

### 💡 The Outcome
We call this "Centaur Trading." We use the machine’s 1000x scale to find the opportunities, and the human’s 10x intuition to verify them.

**Don't build a robot to replace you. Build a tool to amplify you.**

**Do you trust fully autonomous systems with your capital, or do you require a "Human-in-the-Loop"?**
