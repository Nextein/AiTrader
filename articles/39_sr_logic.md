# Bodies vs. Wicks: The War for Support and Resistance 🧱🕯️

Where is the *real* support level? Is it the tip of the wick, or the close of the candle body?

In **AiTrader**, our **Support & Resistance Agent** takes a stand: **Candle bodies tell the truth; wicks tell the stories.**

### 🧱 Why Bodies Matter
A wick is often just a temporary "Look" outside a level—a brief moment of volatility or a liquidity hunt. A candle **Close** (the body), however, represents the final "Agreement" for that timeframe. 

1. **True Structural Pivot**: We identify key levels based on where candle bodies consistently cluster. 
2. **Filtering Noise**: By ignoring the wicks for level identification, we avoid "Ghost Levels" that don't actually hold during a retest.
3. **Validation**: We only consider a level "Broken" if the body of a candle closes beyond it. A wick through the level is just a "SFP" opportunity.

### 🤖 The Code Behind the Level
Our agent uses a density-based clustering algorithm to find where "Price Agrees." It groups candle closes into "Heavy Zones," creating a map of the market that is 10x more reliable than manual line drawing.

**Stop trading the noise. Start trading the consensus.**
