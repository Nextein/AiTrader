# Moving Beyond Indicators: The Power of Specialized Technical Agents 📏

Most people use "Technical Analysis" as a collection of lines on a chart. We treat it as a **distributed computing problem**.

In **AiTrader**, we don't just "run a script" for TA. we have a pool of **Specialized Technical Agents** that function like a team of PhD analysts.

### 📐 The Fibonacci Specialist
This agent doesn't just draw lines. It identifies major swing points across 10+ timeframes, calculates the "Golden Pocket" (61.8% - 78.6%), and—most importantly—only emits a signal when that pocket overlaps with other structural levels.

### 📈 The Anchored VWAP Specialist
Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is the ultimate reality check for price. Our VWAP agent dynamically "anchors" to significant peaks and troughs. It uses Gaussian Processes to project support/resistance zones where the "Smart Money" is likely to step in.

### 🧱 The Key Level Specialist
It’s the "Master Map Maker." It populates the Analysis Object with:
- Previous Day/Month Highs and Lows.
- Weekly/Monthly Opens.
- High-confluence "Value Areas" (VAH/VAL/POC).

### 💡 The Confluence Effect
The magic happens when these agents collaborate. If the **Fibonacci Agent** sees a 66.6% retracement, and the **VWAP Agent** sees a dynamic support line at the exact same price, the system's "Confidence Score" skyrockets.

**One indicator is a hint. Three specialists agreeing is a high-probability trade.**
