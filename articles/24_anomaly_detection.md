# Spotting the "Glitch" in the Matrix: AI-Driven Anomaly Detection 🚨🔍

In systemic trading, bad data is more dangerous than a bad strategy. A single corrupted price spike can trigger a 100% stop-loss or open 1,000 "ghost" positions.

That's why **AiTrader** has a dedicated **Anomaly Detection Agent**.

### 🔍 Spotting the Outliers
Our agent acts as a high-speed "Data Guardian," scanning incoming streams for:
1. **Price Spikes**: If BTC suddenly goes from $60k to $10k and back in 1 second, it’s likely an exchange glitch or a low-liquidity "Flash Crash" that our system shouldn't trade.
2. **Signal Spam**: If a strategy suddenly emits 50 signals for the same asset in 2 minutes, the Anomaly Agent flags it as "Logic Drift" and blocks the execution.
3. **Volume Anomalies**: Identifying "Wash Trading" or artificial liquidity that doesn't represent real market participation.

### 🤖 The "Fail-Safe" Response
When an anomaly is detected:
- **Level 1 (Warning)**: The signal is flagged, and the "Confidence Score" is slashed.
- **Level 2 (Quarantine)**: The asset is temporarily "blacklisted" from new trades. 
- **Level 3 (Alert)**: The Governor Agent is notified to perform a manual review.

### 💡 The Outcome
Resilience. By assuming that data can and will be messy, we build a system that is robust enough to survive the "Glitchy" reality of crypto exchanges.

**Integrity is the most important indicator.**
