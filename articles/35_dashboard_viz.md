# Visualizing the Invisible: The AI Trading Dashboard 📊👁️

How do you monitor 20 agents moving at millisecond speeds? You can't read console logs that fast. You need a **Decision Cockpit**.

In **AiTrader**, we built a real-time dashboard to visualize the "Mental State" of the system.

### 👁️ The Window into the Machine
Our dashboard isn't just about price charts. It focuses on **Reasoning**:
1. **Live Monologue Feed**: See the internal rationales generated by the LLM agents (e.g., "The Sanity agent just blocked BTC due to low liquidity").
2. **Confidence Heatmap**: A color-coded grid showing which symbols have high agreement across our strategy ensemble.
3. **Regime Distribution**: A pie chart showing what percentage of the market is currently Trending, Ranging, or Volatile.
4. **Risk Heat**: Real-time visualization of our aggregate exposure and current drawdown status.

### 🤖 Why Visibility Matters
Trust. When you see exactly *why* the system is sitting on its hands during a choppy market, you’re less likely to manually override it and make a mistake. 

**Observability is the bridge between a "Black Box" and a professional tool.**
