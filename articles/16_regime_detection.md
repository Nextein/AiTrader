# Context is Everything: The Power of Regime Detection 📉📈

"My strategy worked perfectly last month, but now it's bleeding money. What happened?"

The market changed its **Regime**, and your strategy didn't.

In **AiTrader**, we believe that a strategy without a regime filter is just a gamble. That’s why we have a dedicated **Regime Detection Agent**.

### 📉 The Three Market States
Not all price action is created equal. Our agent classifies every asset into one of three primary states:
1. **TRENDING**: High directional conviction (Bull or Bear).
2. **RANGING**: Price is bouncing between clear horizontal levels. Volatility is low.
3. **VOLATILE**: High "noise," large wicks, no clear direction. (Usually a "No-Trade" zone).

### ⚖️ Regime-Adaptive Logic
Detection is just half the battle. The magic is in the **Action**:
- **In a Trending Market**, the system prioritizes Momentum and Breakout strategies. Oscillators (like RSI) are ignored.
- **In a Ranging Market**, the system switches to Mean-Reversion. It "sells the top" and "buys the bottom" of the range.
- **In a Volatile Market**, the Risk Agent automatically scales down position sizes by 50-80% or halts new entries entirely.

### 💡 The Result
We stop fighting the market. Instead of trying to use a trend-following tool in a sideways market, we adapt the tool to the environment. 

**Don't build a better strategy; build a better environment detection system.**
