# Buying the Dip: The Anatomy of a High-Confidence Bounce 🏀📈

Everyone wants to "Buy the Dip," but most people just "Catch the Falling Knife."

How do you tell the difference? In **AiTrader**, we use the **Bounce Strategy Agent**—a specialist that looks for confirmed retests of high-confluence zones.

### 🏀 The "Retest and Go" Logic
A bounce is more than just price hitting a line. It’s a three-act play:
1. **Act 1: The Breakout**: Price breaks a key resistance level (e.g., a VWAP or 20 EMA).
2. **Act 2: The Retest**: Price returns to that level. This is where most traders panic.
3. **Act 3: The Confirmed Bounce**: Price hits the level and shows a "Hammer" or "Engulfing" candle on the lower timeframe, accompanied by a surge in buying volume.

### 🤖 confluence is the Key
Our agent doesn't just look for a line; it looks for a **Cluster**:
- Is the 20 EMA overlapping with a Fibonacci Golden Pocket?
- Is there a "Value Area High" at the same price?
- Is the Market Regime currently Bullish?

If all three are "YES," the signal confidence hits 0.9+. 

### 💡 The Outcome
By waiting for the confirmation *at* the level, we dramatically improve our win rate and decrease our drawdown. 

**Don't predict the bounce. Participate in it.**
