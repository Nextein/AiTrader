# Finding the "Fair Value": Trading with Value Areas (POC/VAH/VAL) 📊🎯

Price is just a number. **Volume** is a commitment. 

To find where the real market "agreement" is, we use the **Value Areas Agent** in **AiTrader**. It maps the "Profile" of where the most trading activity has occurred.

### 📊 The Three Pillars of Value
1. **Point of Control (POC)**: The price level where the absolute most volume was traded. This is the "Fair Value." Price acts like a magnet to the POC.
2. **Value Area High (VAH)**: The upper bound of the range where 70% of the volume occurred.
3. **Value Area Low (VAL)**: The lower bound of that 70% range.

### 🤖 Why It Wins for Systematic Trading
Our agents use these levels as high-probability pivots:
- **Mean Reversion**: If price is at the VAH but the regime is ranging, the POC is a likely target.
- **Breakout Confirmation**: A breakout that happens *outside* the Value Area with sustained volume is 10x more reliable than a breakout within the value range.
- **Support/Resistance**: These levels are derived from human behavior (where they actually traded), making them much stronger than arbitrary indicator lines.

### 💡 The Outcome
We stop chasing price and start trading the consensus. By grounding our execution in the "Volume Profile," we avoid getting trapped in low-liquidity zones.

**Trade where the volume is, not where the hype is.**
