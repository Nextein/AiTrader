# Scaling the "Wisdom of Crowds" with AI Consensus 🗳️

Why trust one indicator when you can have an ensemble of specialized experts?

In traditional quantitative trading, "Alpha" often comes from combining multiple uncorrelated signals. In **AiTrader**, we take this to the next level with our **Consensus & Aggregation Layer**.

### 🏛️ The Digital Boardroom
When price hits a key level, 5 different strategy agents might look at it:
- **EMA Cross Agent**: "Bullish momentum is building."
- **SFP Strategy Agent**: "I see a Swing Failure Pattern. Bearish!"
- **Bounce Strategy Agent**: "Price just retested the 20 EMA. Buy it!"

If these agents all had direct access to the exchange, they'd be fighting each other, wasting fees, and increasing risk.

### ⚖️ The Aggregator Agent: The Ultimate Filter
The **Aggregator** functions as a digital referee. It collects all raw signals and applies **Regime-Adaptive Weighting**:

1. **Weighting by Performance**: Strategies with higher historical Sharpe ratios get more "votes."
2. **Contextual Alignment**: In a `TRENDING` market, momentum signals are prioritized. In `RANGING` markets, oscillators take the lead.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: If the signals are strongly contradictory (e.g., > 0.7 negative correlation), the trade is automatically neutralized. No action is better than a low-probability action.

### 💡 The Result
We achieve a "confluence-based" execution. The system only pulls the trigger when the ensemble reaches a high-confidence consensus. It’s the "Wisdom of Crowds" running at millisecond speeds.
