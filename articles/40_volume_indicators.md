# Following the "Smart Money": The Power of Weiss Waves and OBV 🌊🐳

Price can lie, but volume usually tells the truth. To understand where the "Whales" are moving, **AiTrader** uses a suite of **Volume Specialists**.

### 🌊 Weiss Wave Volume
Most volume indicators are "vertical"—they only show volume per bar. **Weiss Waves** are "horizontal." They group volume into "Wave Swings." 
- It tells us the total cumulative volume of an entire leg of a trend.
- If price is making a "Higher High" but the Weiss Wave volume is smaller than the previous leg, we have **Bearish Divergence**. The trend is exhausting.

### 📈 On-Balance Volume (OBV)
OBV is the "Runway" for price. 
- If OBV is trending up while price is ranging, it indicates **Accumulation**. The smart money is loading up silently.
- If OBV breaks a key level before price does, it’s a "Leading Indicator" that a breakout is imminent.

### 🤖 The Agent Synthesis
Our Volume Agent combines these two with "Volume-Weighted" indicators to provide a single **Liquidity Bias**. It tells the rest of the system if the current move is "Real" or just a "Low-Volume Fakeout."

**Trade with the whales, or you'll be eaten by them.**
