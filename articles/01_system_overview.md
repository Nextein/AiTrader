# Why I Built a 20-Agent Autonomous Trading System 🚀

Manual trading is a losing game of emotions and limited bandwidth. Even the best traders can only track a handful of assets before fatigue sets in.

That's why I designed **AiTrader**—not as a simple bot, but as a sophisticated **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** that digitizes quantitative expertise.

### 🧩 The "Brain" Behind the System
Imagine a trading floor where every desk is a micro-specialist:
- One desk only looks at Market Structure.
- Another только calculates Fibonacci retracements.
- A third manages risk with a "Kill Switch" mentality.
- A "Governor" orchestrates the whole floor.

This is AiTrader. 20+ specialized agents collaborating on a high-performance event bus to scan thousands of crypto assets across multiple timeframes simultaneously.

### 🛡️ Why Defense in Depth?
Most bots fail because they have a single point of failure. If the indicator is wrong, the trade is wrong. 

AiTrader uses a **4-Layer Defense Pipeline**:
1. **Signal Generation**: Multiple strategies (EMA, SFP, Bounce) vote.
2. **Consensus**: An Aggregator resolves conflicts.
3. **Verification**: A Sanity Agent filters "junk" assets using LLMs.
4. **Risk**: A final gatekeeper enforces strict portfolio limits.

### 📈 The Result?
Unwavering discipline, probabilistic precision, and a 1000x increase in market reach.

Stay tuned as I deep-dive into each layer of this architecture over the next few weeks. We're just getting started.
