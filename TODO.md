Support and resistance levels are not being calculated properly. They should be based on previous williams fractals 9 values and should be the closest to price. If price breaks a support, the closest support should immediately be the next fractal down. Currently it seems like the support and resistance levels simply follow the current candle's high and low until a new fractal forms, but this is incorrect since it leaves many occasions without a proper support or resistance level defined. Fix this. If you have any questions on what I'm referring to, ask me.
