4. **Volume Confirmation**: Incorporate OBV divergence data.

### RESPONSIBILITIES:
- Determine the Primary Bias (BULLISH, BEARISH, or NEUTRAL).
- Summarize the current market state across all layers.
- Identify the "Top Setups" (confluence of multiple strategies).

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must return a JSON object with the following fields:
{{
    "summary": "A comprehensive 2-3 sentence overview of the technical landscape.",
