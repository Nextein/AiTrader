## Market Structure 2

## Utility

Used to identify changes in market direction and gain an edge on the market 

## Implementation

Perform 3 steps to assess:

1. Define attempted direction (Up, down, range)
2. Evaluate trade facilitation based on volume.
3. Determine success of that trade facilitation according to its impact on the value area placement.

1. Define attempted direction:

Can have internal market structures bt overall structure is higher highs and higher lows.

2. Evaluate trade facilitation based on volume. Use volume as primary means to determine directional performance.

High volume can confirm the validity of a move.
Low volume may suggest a lac of conviction.

Check stats like average to see if volume is increasing or decreasing, and detect and significant dev iations fromthe average.

Increase in volume spikes during pumps => healthy uptrend.

3. Determine success of trade based on impact on value area placement. He typically uses the 30m timeframe Volume Profile judging a medium timeframe trend.

A sstructural indicator is Value Area Placement, determine progress by value area of one day relates to the next to determine how good of a job is it moving.

Were buyers successful placing value higher?

## Implementation

Value area can be clearly higher or lower, indicating strong directional performance

Value can overlap to one side or the other indicating a lesser degree of conviction or change.

Value can be contained within previous day's value area in which case it is considered contained. Consolidation or indecision in the market. If it happens within the trend, it may suggest that conviction is slowing down and can help identify early shifts in the trend.

Summary:

| Attempted Direction | Relationship Volume | Relationship Value Area | Directional Performance |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Up   | Higher | Higher | Very Strong |
| Up   | Higher | Overlapping | Moderately Strong |
| Up   | Higher | Unchanged | Balancing |
| Up   | Lower  | Higher | Slowing |

# How to spot a trend

Trade with the trend. "The trend is your Friend" - Jesse Livermore.

Biggest wins come from trends. And biggest losses when against the trend.

NEVER FIGHT IT.

Recognise where the market is going and take a piece of it.

K.I.S.S - KEEP IT SUPER SIMPLE

When trend trading it's fairly simple, don't complicate it.

Is it a distribution, or accumulation?

Don't use indicators to do work for you but to indicate something that will help us manage our analysis.

How do trends begin?

- Data releases. If you are ignoring you are making a huge mistake.

Exmaples: CPI & PPI release. Don't know what they do but they impact volatility.

USD inversely correlates with stock markets which correlates to chartchampions. Know when these impacts are coming.

- Fundamentals: Important in regulated stocks, not so much in crypto.

- Environmental: Important world events. Black swan events. Major and minor ones like 2023 fake image that the pentagon was attacked followed by a massive move to the downside.

- Breaking out of an accumulation

- Exhaustion (example: no sells, no new lows). In order for an imbalance to a sell side to begin you need more sells otherwise you will get a continuation to the upside.

## Utility

What causes trends to end?

- Data releases
- Fundamentals
- Environmental
- Break down off a distribution. There's an accumulation. Trend will end if node being elongated in a range, it loses that node and backtests it as resistance, that node is lost and "down off".

- Huge volume drop off after multiple large legs. If volume is not dropping off, price is going to keep going.

## Implementation

VWAP

Not traded so much in indexes.

Prior bar lows or highs (one time framing). Easiest way to see if we're with the trend or not.

Previous legs lows untested during puptrend.

LTF EMA 8/24 on 1m 5m, one time framing previous candle on 15m 1h.

SMA 50 Local structure. If price is sort of ranging, 50 is good, if value areas are moving and strong uptrend he uses 8/24 EMAs.

## Tips

Trend will always be your friend, never fight it.

Don't discredit lagging indicators, especially in traditional markets. Use in confluence, don't just rely on them.

The market is always efficient, trader's are the ones who are not!

Allow trend indicator combinations to assist you with your daily bias.
