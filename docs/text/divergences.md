he never trades with divergences alone.

It is very common to get divergences on indicators when the second move is usually with less momentum than the first strong breakout move.

## Divergences

Bullish divergences - for downtrend reversal

price = lower low
oscillator= higher low

after an extended downtrend and an incoming support level (ie monthly or fib), it is a sign the selling pressure is weakening

Bearish divergences - for uptrend reversal
same flipped.

calculate oscillator indicators with candle closes, not wicks.

Hidden bullish divergences - for uptrend continuation

Price = higher low
oscillator = lower low

You're only interested in these within an uptrend, they mean nothing in a downtrend.

Hidden bearish divergences - for downtred continuation
Price = lower high
oscillator = higher high


ONLY USE THESE WITH CONFLUENCE.

Look at highs and lows of price looking at closes, not wicks. So price and oscillator are both looking at closes.
