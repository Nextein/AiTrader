# Open Interest & Fuding

Extremely useful when trading a macro trend.

Can be used to identify how "healthy" a trend is.

OI is a MUST.

Use to pickup on patterns.
example: Every time 1B OI on BTC price would fall. It is no longer the case.

Funding is an important fee. Understand how it can influence price.

| Price | Volume | OI | Market |
| Rising 
| Rising
| Declining
| Declining

You want to see price, volume and OI increasing for a strong uptrend.

Volume and OI increasing = strong
Volume and OI decreasing = weak


If volume and OI are declining, the current trend can be viewed as exhausted and is bearish.


# Open Interest

With price moving up and OI increasing, this shows that new money is coming into the market. Considered bullish.

If price is rising and OI declines, movement is likely because of short closes, not long openings, meaning once the shorts are closed, price will ten drop back down. Not necessarily downtrend, just reversal back to the next area of demand (value area).

Same on the flipside.

# Funding
Used by exchanges to make traders want to close or open positions by offering an attractive funding.

You can close position 1 minute before funding and not pay.

Sometimes when funding changes to a huge value, the minute it activates, positions are opened and price moves because of the funding only.

Normal funding is 0.01%
anything above 0.02% is weighted. Above 0.04% it's high, anything above 0.07% is extreme,

Funding isn't causing massive moves like it used to.

extreme funding requires funding.
