# Types of traders

## Utility

4 main styles:

- Scalp
- Day
- Swing
- Position Trading (investing)

You can be all types simultaneously to maximise profits.

## Implementation

Scalp Trading:

Volume charts (Every 5M Volume paint a candle)
1m - 3m - 5m

Day trading:

30m

Swing trading:

4h+ timeframe (daily, weekly)

Position trading:

weekly as lowest. Like investing, use chart to determine when to enter and sell off investment.

Most styles make similar profits, although scalp traders can make a bit more profits.

There is no right or way wrong of trading.

Decide style based on personal style.

Scalp trading is great for gamers who are at the PC long periods of time.

Swing trading is for people with families or busy lives as it is much more relaxed style of trading. Preset limit orders maybe before going to work.

Day trading is in the middle of the two, a mix of both. LTF entries that require order flow but you can take a trade, walk away for a few hours and come back. Trade for exmaple the 15m trade.

Scalp trading requires a lot more discipline, using information received live in the time, not planned ahead.

## Tips

Swing traders can use scalp trader tactics for their entries. Set alerts and watch live for LTF trigger.


# Types of trader 2

He used to be a scalp trader, 100 trades a day. Now he is a swing trader, one trade a day, sometimes only taking one trade a week.

Now he is a combination of them both.

## Implementation

Do HTF analysis and place alerst where he has interest in a trade entry.

Once alerst get triggered, I zoom into LTF and look at scalp entry.

I will then hold that entry for the HTF idea of a swing trade.

He loves looking at the 3m chart in tradingview and order flowL volume, OI, delta, trade counts... Then he takes the decision of "Do I want to take the trade?"

Scalpers mindset of wanting to get the very best entry.

He still spends all day every day at his computer. He chooses this style because it's what he prefers.

If there is high volatility hec an always scalp and take more trades. He's flexible.

Once the alert is triggers, zoom into the LTF to make the informed decision to take th etrade or not + best entry price.


Look at tradingview for context.
 Then look at 3 templates in orderflow: 30m chart, 10M volume and 
ORderflow to look at delta, volume, cvd, trade counts and OI.

In that wick did we have OI increasing with new shorts opening.
