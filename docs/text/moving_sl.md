# Moving Stop Loss

## Utility

Many people get into a nice trade, but then move SL too quickly to break even, avoiding risk, missing the whole move.

Risk free doesn't exist. What about risk of missing the trade still there?

Only move SL when invalidation changes. In no other condition. You don't move just because a TP was hit.

Differentiate between a swing trade setup and a scalp trade. What is it?
scalp trade: tight SL.
swing trade: SL much further away

If swing trading your TP1 can easily take a few days to hit, unless using his TP1 intra day technique.


## Implementation

If TP1 is hit, he won't move SL o entry. Only invalidation changes.

When moving SL, think of placing it where you qould place it if you entered a trade now.
