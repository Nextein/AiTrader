 Hello and welcome to this patterns module. Today, we're going to be covering harmonic patterns part one
 Please pause this video and take a moment to read this trade disclaimer as the information contained in this video is
 Not financial advice and is only for educational purposes in this module. We will cover the utility of
 harmonic patterns
 how to implement a few external and internal patterns correctly and
 Then go over some examples and tips and tricks on how to best use them
 Harmonic patterns are powerful Fibonacci constructs
 They are a combination of Fibonacci retracement
 the Fibonacci expansion the Fibonacci extension and
 Also very important Fibonacci time
 Harmonic patterns can provide bullish and bearish entries as well as price targets
 Now we will cover the implementation of a few harmonic patterns
 First we will go over two internal or consolidation harmonic patterns the bat and the guardley
 Then we will cover three external patterns the ABCD the butterfly and the crab
 All of these patterns work best on the four-hour and higher timeframes
 The bat harmonic pattern is an internal pattern where xa can be an impulse of any size
 point B is a retracement from the three a two to the point five of xa and
 This is a requirement
 To have a perfect bat a retracement to the point five is required
 Point C is from the three a two to the eight eight six retracement of a to be
 It is preferred to have the retracement be between the point five and the point six one eight
 Finally point D the target of the harmonic pattern is the eight eight six of
 x to a and
 In the region of the one point six one eight to two point six one eight expansion of B to C
 Once point D is reached and there is available confluence
 it is possible to enter a trade from D and
 target the six one eight of C to D and
 As a secondary target point A
 Now let's have a look at a visual example of the bat harmonic pattern
 It is possible to draw this pattern using the xa BCD tool
 on trading view
 The completed pattern then looks like this
 Let's check the Fibonacci requirements
 For point B it is necessary to have a retracement of the move from x to a to the three a two
 up to the point five
 For a perfect bat the retracement for B should be to the point five. This is the case
 For point C
 We use the Fibonacci retracement tool from A to B and look for C to B between the three a two to the eight eight six
 retracement
 Ideally it should be between the point five and the point six one eight. This is also the case
 For point D
 We can use the retracement from x to a and
 The eight eight six level as a target for D
 The second option is
 To use the one point six one eight to two point six one eight region of the expansion from B to C
 As you can see these two tools together already provide nice confluence for point D
 To establish targets
 For a trade taken from D
 We can use a Fibonacci retracement from C to D an aim for the six one eight and
 All the way down to A or the beginning of the pattern
 The stop loss would then be above X
 To check the symmetry of the pattern we can use the Fibonacci time tool and measure from X to A
 And expand it from A as we can see
 Point B is the one-to-one time extension of X to A
 Then we can check the duration from A to B and expand it from C to get a time target for point D
 This example shows a bearish bad pattern offering a short entry setup from D
 To trade a bullish bad pattern it can simply be inverted for a long entry at D
 following the same criteria
 The guardly harmonic pattern is an internal pattern where XA once again
 Can be an impulse of any size?
 Point B is then the six one eight retracement of X to A
 This is a requirement
 The six six is also acceptable
 Point C is a three eight two two eight eight six retracement from A to B
 The six one eight is preferred
 Finally point D is the seven eight six Fibonacci retracement from X to A which is preferred
 And in the region of the one point two seven two to one point six one eight
 expansion of B to C
 finally the targets from D are the six one eight of C to D and
 also the one-to-one extension of XA from D
 This is the case if the time from X to A is the same as from D to that one-to-one extension target
 Let's have a look at a visual example of the guardly harmonic pattern
 This pattern can also be drawn using the XA BCT pattern tool on trading view
 The completed pattern looks like this
 Let's check the fib levels
 For point B
 It is necessary to have a retracement of the move from X to A to the six one eight
 The six six is also unacceptable target
 For point C
 It is preferred to see a retracement of the move from A to B
 also to the six one eight
 Even though
 between the three a two and the eight eight six is also acceptable
 For point D
 The seven eight six of the move from X to A is preferred
 here
 The second option is the region between the one point two seven two and the one point six one eight of
 the Fibonacci expansion from B to C
 The price targets or a short trade taken from D would be
 the six one eight of the Fibonacci retracement from C to D here and
 also
 the one-to-one extension of
 the move from X to A
 extended from D
 down here
 The trade would then look like this with an entry a D a stop loss above X and
 I'd take profit one at the six one eight and possibly a final target at the one-to-one extension
 of the move XA from D
 Once again, the symmetry of the pattern is important
 Here we can see that B is at the one-to-one time extension of
 X to A from A
 We can also see
 that A to B extended from C
 Gives a one-to-one time extension where D takes place
 as a special case in
 order to reach this Fibonacci one-to-one extension for the trade setup
 It is important to check the time from X to A and
 extended from D
 So that it also has a one-to-one time extension
 This example is a bearish guardly pattern
 offering a short trade setup from D
 By simply inverting the pattern it is possible to have a bullish
 guardly pattern with a long entry at D following the same criteria
 The ABCD pattern is an external pattern
 where AB can be an impulse of any size
 It is important to pay attention to symmetry and
 Ideally A to B should be the same Fibonacci time length as C to D
 Point C is simply a six one eight to seven eight six retracement of A to B
 Here some leeway is allowed
 finally point D is
 the one point two seven two to one point six one eight expansion of B to C
 Here we can have two rules
 If C retraced to the seven eight six of AB
 Then the target for D is at the one point two seven two expansion
 However, if C retraced to the six one eight of AB then the target at D changes to the one point six one eight expansion of B to C
 finally
 Traits entered from D can have a target at B
 at the three eight two and six one eight of C to D and
 finally A
 Let's have a look at a visual example of the ABCD pattern
 We can draw this pattern on trading view using the tool by the same name
 Once completed the pattern should look like this
 Let's check the fib levels
 For C we want to see a retracement of the move from A to B
 between the six one eight and the seven eight six
 for point D
 The region between the one point two seven two and the one point six one eight
 Fibonacci expansion of the move from B to C is
 the target for D
 Here we can use two rules
 if C retraced to the six one eight of AB like on this example
 Then we can expect D
 to be at the one point six one eight expansion of the move from B to C
 However, if C
 retraces to the seven eight six of the move from A to B then we can expect D
 to be at the one point two seven two
 expansion of B to C
 To establish price targets for a possible long from D
 From this bullish ABCD pattern
 We can use the Fibonacci retracement from C to D and
 target B
 Which is in this case also the three eight two
 and the six one eight
 as well as a
 at the top of the pattern
 The trade setup would then look like this
 Once again, it is possible to invert the pattern to trade it bearishly from D
 and
 take a short position
 With the same price targets and using the same criteria
 The symmetry for this pattern is very important
 We can use the Fibonacci time tool to measure the time from A to B and
 extend it from C
 To establish the one-to-one time extension for D
 The butterfly harmonic pattern is an external pattern where once again
 X to A can be an impulse of any size
 B must then be a
 786 retracement of X to A
 Point C is then a retracement from the three a two to the eight eight six of A to B
 Here a six one eight retracement is preferred
 D is then in the region of the one point six one eight to two point six one eight expansion of B to C
 And the region of the one point two seven two to one point six one eight expansion of X to A
 Finally the targets for traits taken from D are B
 And the six one eight from A to D
 Let's have a look at a visual example of the butterfly harmonic pattern
 This pattern can be drawn using the X A B C D pattern tool on trading view
 The finished pattern looks like this
 Let's check the fib levels
 Point B has to be a 786 retracement of the move from X to A
 This is a requirement
 Point C
 Can be a retracement between the three eight two and the eight eight six of the move from A to B
 However, a retracement to the six one eight is preferred
 Point D
 Should be in the region between the one point six one eight and the two point six one eight of the Fibonacci expansion
 from B to C
 Option two is
 The region between the one point two seven two and the one point six one eight of the Fibonacci expansion from X to A
 By using both tools together we can already see confluence for a possible price target for D
 Possible price targets for a short trade taken from this bearish butterfly pattern from D
 would be B and
 the six one eight of
 The Fibonacci retracement from A to D
 The stop loss can be placed at an area beyond the one point six one eight
 expansion from X to A
 However, we recommend that you use market structure for stop loss placement
 To check the symmetry of the pattern we can use the Fibonacci time tool in this example
 We see that point B is at the zero point six one eight time extension of the move from X to A
 We can also see that the move from A to B
 Expanded from C gives us a one-to-one time extension for D
 Once again in order to trade a bullish
 Butterfly pattern we can simply invert the pattern and follow the same criteria
 For a trade setup entering a long at D
 The crab harmonic pattern is also an external pattern where once again XA can be an impulse of any size
 Point B is then a three eight two six one eight retracement of X to A
 The six one eight retracement is preferred
 Point C is then a retracement between the three eight two to eight eight six of eight to B
 Here a point five to point six one eight retracement is preferred
 Point D is then a two point two four to three point six one eight expansion of B to C
 Where the three point one four level is preferred?
 If A to B is the same as C to D with Fibonacci time
 Then D can be at the one point six one eight expansion of X to A
 Also D can be at the one point six one eight extension from A to B by simply double clicking B
 The targets for trades taken from D are the six one eight of C to D and A
 Let's have a look at a visual example of the crab harmonic pattern
 This pattern can be drawn using the XA/BCD pattern tool on trading view
 Once completed it should look like this
 Let's check the fib levels
 Or point B. We are looking for a retracement between the three eight two and the six one eight of
 The move from X to A
 The preferred retracement is the six one eight
 For point C. We are looking for a retracement between the three eight two and
 The eight eight six of the move from A to B
 The preferred retracement here is between the point five and the point six one eight
 For point D we are looking at a target between the two point two four and
 The three point six one eight Fibonacci expansion from B to C
 The three point one four level is preferred
 It is also possible to use the one point six one eight
 Fibonacci expansion level of the move from X to A
 If the pattern is symmetrical
 The third option is to use a Fibonacci extension from A to B and
 Double-clicking B to get the one point six one eight extension as a price target for D
 If we turn on all three tools, we can then find confluence for the best possible target
 The price targets or this bearish crab harmonic pattern
 would be
 the six one eight of the move from C to D and
 also A
 The trade setup for a short taken from D would look like this
 To place the stop loss
 We can use the one point six one eight of the Fibonacci expansion from X to A
 However, once again, we recommend using market structure for stop loss placement
 To trade the crab harmonic pattern
 Bullishly we can simply
 Invert the pattern and enter a long position from D
 using the same criteria
 Once again, the symmetry of the pattern is very important in
 This case we have point B at the 0.618 time extension of the move
 from X to A
 Also, we have symmetry as A to B
 extended from C
 Gives us a one-to-one time extension for D
 Now let's go over some tips and tricks on how to best use these harmonic patterns
 The difference between the bat and the guardley pattern is the retracement to B
 The best entry for the butterfly pattern is when A to B is the same as C to D in Fibonacci time
 Here we can have D at the 1.272 extension of A to B from B
 In order to implement harmonic patterns correctly it is important to pay attention to the correct look
 By looking at the symmetry between each wave and the time for each wave as well
 The volume profile of an internal harmonic pattern is that of a consolidation pattern
 Officially it is recommended to trade a harmonic from the D of the harmonic pattern as it completes
 For more advanced traders with more experience with Fibonacci and harmonics
 It is possible to trade these patterns already from C
 This is always dependent on the available confluence
 We recommend that you never trade a harmonic pattern alone and always look for confluence at the important levels
 It is best to use market structure for stop-loss placement and
 Or take profit targets on the trades, even if they are based on harmonics
 Here is the take-home message for this module
 Harmonic patterns are powerful Fibonacci constructs
 Symmetry and time are very important to get the correct look for these patterns and implement them accurately
 These patterns work best on higher time frames with additional confluence
 This concludes today's module. Thank you for watching and I'll see you on the next one
 Happy learning and happy trading
