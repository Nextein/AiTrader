## Utility

MAny people take too much profits too early or too little, ultimately because they have no system.

Have a plan that includes entry, SL, and TP locations and % ahead of time.

## Implememntatino

% TP included when plannig ahead.

Hard TP1, TP2, trails SL after that.

- TP1: protection to minimise loss.

There is no right or wrong, do what fits your plan.

TP depends on context of trade. Sometimes take 50% on TP1 or 5% on TP1.

## Tips

TP1 as intraday level such as vWAP or mini range POCs.

TP2 as swing traders high probability reversal level such as overall rnge high, HTF strong confluence.

At such high probability reveral at TP2 we can also look to open a short trade (for at least hedged short trade).

TP2 definitely take it but maybe decide in the moment what amount. More than 30% recommended.

Next TP3 is the HTF range high where he might enter a hedged short. He would take profits if he sees signs of weakness, or trail SL of he sees strength.

Nobody ever went broke taking profits.

## TIPS

PLAN PLAN PLAN. If you do not plan your TP's, you will make big mistakes.

His biggest weakness when he used to fail was to not take enough profits. "I could have made more". 

Once he changed that his trading improved massively.

Instead of what could have, PROFIT IS PROFIT. Never be annoyed about TP and then price moves further.
