At least 90% of traders lose money. One particular reason is that they lack planning and a proven formula to manage their risk, which in turn also protects their capital.

Here you will find a simple step-by-step formula to calculate your risk and position size, regardless of how much money you trade with.

 

Remember if you get the position size and risk management right, you're halfway there.

### Utility

Use this formula BEFORE taking every single trade.

Position size is not your account balance.

This formula will help you calculate the correct position size and employ correct risk management.

### Implementation

Know your risk before entering trade.

You need to know your entry, invalidation and SL, and our TP.
$$
\$Risk = \%Risk \times \text{Account Balance}
$$

$$
Trade\ Amount = \frac{Risk}{SL\% / 100}
$$


## Leverage

We also have cheat sheets available for this topic which can be downloaded as a high-res PDF via our vault section here : https://portal.chartchampions.com/vault  - download is titled ‘Position Size and Leverage’

 

Warning: Trading on high leverage is extremely risky and is not recommended.

 

For the experienced trader, leverage can provide a benefit to a high probability position. However, the experienced trader is aware that there are both pros and cons to using leverage and margin.

Many professional traders will disclose that they do not use leverage, nor do they find it necessary. At Chart Champions we will never advocate high-risk leverage trading, yet it is still important for you to be educated on various trading instruments and the risks they pose.

Remember, protecting your capital is your priority.

### Utility

A) Trade more contracts than you have for larger position sizes and account growth quicker via bigger profits.

B) Less exposure on exchange when used correctly. This is best use case of leverage.

Larger losses.
More leverage = closer liquidation price.

Liquidation = potentisl of losing sll your account in 1 trade. (Cross leverage)

### Implementation

1x leverage:
$1000 position size. +- $10 for every 1% move.

100x leverage:
$100,000 position size. +-$1000 for every 1% move.

### Implementation

Cross vs isolated margin.

Don't use more than 5x leverage. It's very dangerous.


### tips

Using cross will keep liquidation far away.

Isolated will control max loss in the event of liquidation.

Always place a SL at invalidation price. Don't rely on liquidation as a SL placement.
