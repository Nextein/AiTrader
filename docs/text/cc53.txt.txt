 Hello and welcome to this strategies module today. We're going to be covering the day trading strategy
 Please pause this video and take a moment to read this trade disclaimer as the information contained in this video is
 Not financial advice and is only for educational purposes
 In this module. We will cover the utility of this day trading strategy
 How to correctly implement it and then go over some examples and tips and tricks on how to best use it
 The day trading strategy is an advanced strategy producing generally one to four trades per day
 It combines momentum volume and confluence
 This day trading strategy is less time-consuming than the chart champions scalping strategy
 In order to implement the day trading strategy, you will need footprint statistics software such as exochards or ATAS
 The key components of the strategy are TPO charts open interest
 volume and momentum and
 Fibonacci
 The first step of the day trading strategy is to check the momentum
 For this you can use the 15-minute time frame market structure, which will show you the trend
 Volume will show the strength of the move and
 Open interest will show the aggressiveness of the move
 The second step of the day trading strategy is to establish
 confluence by using Fibonacci tools
 Fibonacci is the primary tool for confluence, especially the champions channel
 between the 618 and the 666 Fibonacci levels
 The 796 is a Fibonacci level that can be used in low-volume environments
 And the point to eight can be used in high momentum environments such as trending days
 The third step of the day trading strategy is to use volume tools and TPO charts to establish the entries
 The volume tools are value areas
 Points of control and the session VWAP, which can give us the entries
 TPO charts offer us single prints and high time notes, which are highly favorable
 Now let's have a look at a practical example
 First we can have a look on trading view at the 15-minute chart to establish what the market structure for today is
 Here we can see that we are making lower highs and
 ranging initially
 To then begin to make lower lows lower highs and lower lows
 Thus giving us a local downtrend for the day
 Our trade idea will revolve around a possible bounce
 through the VWAP to the CC or even the 786
 We will now attempt to find the strongest confluence at each of these levels and then use
 momentum, volume, TPO and open interest to judge the right time to enter a possible short trade
 Now let's have a look at the chart champions scalping template on exocharts
 We have said the chart type to five million volume and we are on the buybit BTC USD pair
 We can observe that the VWAP is lining up with today's point of control as well as the previous day value area low
 For the specific move in question. We are looking at a possible bounce up to these resistance levels
 Based on the Fibonacci pool done on trading view
 We know that the champions channel
 lines up with the daily open and
 the weekly point of control as well as today's value area high offering yet another
 interesting area of resistance for a possible short entry
 Now we can use the power of this template to judge
 momentum, volume in
 combination with open interest to decide where our trade entry should be
 Initially we have a move towards the VWAP on increasing open interest and
 increasing longs with shorts closing
 This section of the move is thus
 strong or healthy and not necessarily a trigger for an immediate short trade at this resistance level
 Thus we do not enter and wait for further data
 As we wait for more confirmation to take the trade
 We see that price action begins to dance around the VWAP point of control and previous day value area low
 Finally we have a decisive move to the upside with larger
 volume candles
 showing lower liquidity in the move and
 also
 decreasing open interest
 This tells us this this move heading towards our next area of resistance is not a strong move
 Based on this volume momentum open interest TPO and
 Confluence information of the daily open the weekly point of control the value area high and the Fibonacci
 96 level we decide to enter our short trade position
 Now let's have a look at how the trade plays out on trading view as
 We already saw on the exo charts template. We have a move up through the VWAP
 rejecting initially from the CC with a subsequent dancing around the VWAP and one last push
 All the way up to the 786
 To then finally begin rejecting and moving lower
 Thus giving our short entry trigger at the confluence area here a
 very nice day trade short opportunity
 We can even activate the CCW template
 To see that price rejected exactly off the 0.796 level and
 We can use the VWAP area of confluence as a take profit for our short trade as well as the 0.28
 Now let's go over some tips and tricks
 Reading momentum and market context is extremely crucial
 You should ask questions such as are longs or shorts getting aggressive is
 Open interest following the aggression
 For this day trading strategy we recommend that you use the 5 million volume chart
 An example of strong confluence for this strategy is the session VWAP
 lining up with a point of control and a Fibonacci level a
 Perfect trading strategy does not exist and you can customize this day trading strategy to fit your personal style
 The final piece of the puzzle is found with experience
 Patience is very important if there is no trade setup. You simply do not take a trade
 Here is the take-home message for this module in the day trading strategy
 Momentum gives us the trade direction long or short
 Volume gives us the entries
 Finally Fibonacci tools give us the confluence
 This concludes today's module. Thank you for watching and I'll see you on the next one. Happy learning and happy trading
