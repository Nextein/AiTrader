# Liquidity Zones

Market orders take liquidity out of the market, limit orders add liquidity. It's market orders that move price.

Where do the most amount of transactions take place? Stop Losses.

Limit orders are most likely to get filled where there are the most market orders.

SLs are great places to get your orders filled.


Stop Losses:

- Market structure
- Consolidation areas are very good SR areas. Support in uptrend and resistance in downtrend. Place SL just below the consolidation area. Naturally many SLs are placed there and that's where you can get your orders filled.

## Swing Failure Pattern

Also called liquidity grabs. An attempt to take a "swing" above or below a significant high or low.

SFPs happen on all timeframes. The larger the timeframe the bigger or stronger the signal is.

SFPs can either trade into a short term retracement or a complete reversal.

SFP takes out the low and closes back above the low.

## From scalp to swing

Really good to let scalp trades turn into swing trades.

## How to trade SFP as beginner

Short: 

1. Wait for price to take the high.

2. Wait for candle close below the previous high/low and back inside the local range.

3. TP at the bottom of the range.

4. Compound or let the trade run as you see changes in Market Structure.

## How to trade SFP advanced

1. Look for trapped traders.

Very high activity at the lows. You can see by all the red colored text in the candles. These are called selling imbalances.

You also want to see the POC of the wick candle close to the low, signalling most volume was traded in that wick.

New shorts opening. You also want to see people exiting their longs.

Compare volume and delta.

Drop in price, decrease in OI, Large volume and large negative delta -> lot of selling.

Then large volume but smaller delta, less selling than earlier.

2. Look for demand to show up:

- look for buying imbalances after.
- Increase in open interest - new longs opening, don't confuse with sells closing.

3. Change in market structure in LTF and traded tf.

Do not catch the knife.

If a lot of short are opening at the lows, this is bearish. We need to see them get trapped and buying demand showing up after to signal a reversal


Wait for change in market structure to have a very clear invalidation area and avoid catching the knife. Liquidity has just been taken, meaning there is no more liquidity to be taken in that area, making it a legitimate area to place our SL.

Entering with less than these 3 requirements is a lower grade trade and is more risky, maybe adjust position size accordingly.
