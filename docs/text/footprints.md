# Footprint Charts

ExoCharts is a powerful footprint chart software. You will be able to monitor volume, delta, open interest, and DBO. This will provide you with the ability to perform professional order flow analysis, which will offer you a clear advantage in combination with technical analysis. In order to use ExoCharts, you will need to pay for a subscription of about $30 per month. You will have access to multiple chart types, including volume, delta, and trend reversal charts. There is a web version available, as well as a desktop pro version. Now let's have a look at a practical example. First, we're going to start by loading up a template shared in the Discord. This is the Chart Champions template. We have to open the text file, select the entire content, and then go to Template here on the top left, and click Import. We proceed to paste the full text into this space here, and then hit Import again. This will now show up at the bottom of our list, where we can then assign it to a hotkey, or simply click on Load. Once we have done that, you can see that we now have the standard template loaded and available. Now let's go over some of the main features of this template. It is very important that you always check that you are on the correct trading pair. Here on the top left, you can select the exchange as well as the pair. In this case, it's the Bybit BTC USD pair. This is the pair with the best order flow, and hence the reason why we prefer it. After we've selected the trading pair, we can now choose which type of chart we would like to see. We can either choose a time interval, similar to what is available on TradingView, or we can choose Delta Charts, Volume Charts, or even Trend Reversal Charts. These charts provide you with a different point of view for the same data, based on delta, or volume, instead of time. The next setting available is Tick Size. On this template, it is set to 50, which is fitting where the timeframe is selected. If you intend to scout trade on lower timeframes, a lower tick size may be more appropriate. There is no right or wrong value here, so you can experiment with different values. Our next option is the Cluster option on this drop-down menu. Here, we have Delta Cluster selected. It is also possible to select Volume Profile, Delta Profile, Bid As Profile, Volume Cluster, and Delta Cluster. These provide you with the same information, but with different visual representations. In order to see these settings better, let's turn off some of the other settings. Now you can see that only the Delta Cluster setting has been activated, and when we zoom in, we have no data in here, and simply color shading. This is already very valuable information. As you can see, the darker shading represents a higher concentration of delta. If we switch to a Volume Cluster, the darker shading represents a higher concentration of volume. This can be quite useful for setting up possible trades, as areas of high volume or high delta concentration, once revisited, can prove to be support or resistance depending on the confluence. If you choose the Volume Profile option, you will see how much volume was traded at each level within each candle. If you select Delta Profile, you will see the same information, with the additional information of knowing how much buying or selling was involved at each level. Now let's have a look at the Bid As Profile option. As you can see, it now shows you the buying on the right side and the selling on the left side. Let's turn off some of the other features to see this a little bit better. As you can see, sometimes when there is a very impulsive price move, there is very little volume involved. And once you reach a certain level, the sell or the buy volume increases. Ideally, when losing a level of support, let's say this one here, you would like to see that the selling intensifies below the level, showing you acceptance there. Conversely, when claiming a level, after the initial impulsive move, it is ideal to see a thicker buy side on the Bid As Profile as compared to the sell side, reminding us of the letter P. This would indicate acceptance above the level. Now let's have a look at the text options. Zooming in, we can see that if we choose Volume, we have a numerical representation of the volume traded at each level. If we choose Delta, we instead see the Delta at each level. If we choose Bid Ask, the candle is divided into two sides. The left side shows us the market sell orders, and the right side shows us the market buy orders. If we activate the Imbalance option, we can see the imbalances highlighted. The next setting is Candle. Usually, it is set to None on this template. One useful feature could be OHLC, or Open, High, Low, Close, which shows you the shape of the actual candle on TradingView, so that you can see if the volume was accumulated in the wake of the candle or in the body of the candle. Additionally, we can turn on a Volume Profile, the Trade Count, or the Rect setting, showing us short liquidations in green and long liquidations in red. Next, we will turn on the Footprint Bar Statistics again. Here we can see two rows with cumulative volume Delta, one for session and one for the full data, a row with volume and a row with Delta per candle. By clicking on the cogwheel here on the bottom left, you can modify the rows that are being shown or add new rows with different data depending on what you would like to analyze. By activating the Trade Size option, it is possible to see the market orders grouped by their different size. Next, we can activate the Candlestick Statistics to see below or above the candle the information that is also shown in the Footprint Bar Statistics, in this case, volume and Delta per candle. Next, we can activate the D-bars, which shows you a visual representation of cumulative volume Delta. This is very useful to read CDD divergences. If we turn on the Market Settings again, we can see on the right for this template the previous day value area high, the previous day equilibrium, the previous day point of control, the previous day value area low, as well as the daily open. By activating the Value Area setting, it is possible to see where most of the volume was transacted for each candle. By enabling the POC setting, we are also shown with a red line where the point of control for each candle is. Additionally, this template has a volume profile on the left and a depth of market profile on the right already built in. If we zoom out, we can see this on the left and also on the right side of the screen. Let's have a look at some of the other available templates. This is the Open Interest template, showing us Open Interest at the bottom, Net Shorts in the middle, and Net Longs at the top. Here we can then easily use this to determine whether a certain move in price is healthy or not, depending on what Open Interest is doing. This is the standard TPO template, or Time Price Opportunity, where we can see the sessions, naked points of control, single print rows, buying tails, selling tails, value areas, and so on. The Daily Volume Profile template is very useful to identify where naked points of control from previous daily sessions are located. If we then simply change the timeframe to weekly and to monthly, we can see where the naked points of control from these respective sessions are located. ExoCharts calculates volume more accurately than TradingView. Atas and SierraCharts are alternative footprint software platforms. Here is the take-home message for today's module. ExoCharts is a professional footprint chart software. With it, it is possible to monitor order flow, including volume, delta, and open interest. It is a very powerful addition to your trading arsenal and can take your trading to the next level. This concludes today's module.


## Utility

see amount of volume transacted at each price.
where there are many buyers and sellers horizontally -> find key SR levels

Determine acceptance or rejection above/below a level with great accuracy.

After breaking above a resistance, it is successful breakout if you see large buy volume above the level.


Delta Cluster: 


# Footprint Charts

## Utility
look inside canle and see the amount of volume at each price

See where there are many buyers and sellers horizontally -> identify SR levels

Determine acceptance above/below key level with precision

## Implementation

ATAS

Use in conjunction with TA at previously determined key levels

Monitor Order flow, including OI, volume and delta. Specially useful when scalping.

Delta cluster with no text: Can see volume, delta and CV in a table below. Use to determine key levels.

## Tips

Bid Ask Profile -> most useful when day trading to see live buying and selling interest when approaching a key level.

There is no right tick size, can experiment with different values. He recommends a higher tick size or HTF analysis.

Value area => 68% of volume was traded.

Use OHLC setting to see shape of candle. Volume could be mostly in the wick.

Only market orders are shown in footprint charts.


Determine reactions at key levels. Delta profile, larger buying node means acceptance above that level.


# Delta

## Utility

Delta is sum of aggressive market orders (buys - sells)

Shows whether buyers or sellers are in control of the current candle.

Delta is useful to determine possible breakouts and reversals at key levels.

## Implementation

ATAS required.

Monitor to determine whether price movement is healthy.

Use in conjunction with OI, Volume and CVD.

## Background info

Passive = limit
Active = market orders

Price can only move when market orders are placed.

## Tips

Healthy price move is characterised by an increase in aggressive market orders (volume) and positive (uptrend) delta

If volume and delta are decreasing on a move, price is likely to reverse.

It is possible to have a green candle with negative delta and viceversa.

In range trading, expect a decrease in delta as edges of range are approached.

Rande bound price action: we can observe active selling at top of the range and active buying at bottom of the range.

Healthy breakout is accompanied by a strong volume and increasing delta.

Decreasing volume and delta signals weakness and a likely reversal into the range.

Areas with high delta (darket shading) can offer reversal point when revisited. Use in confluence with technical analysis.

# CVD

Limit orders are generally used by bigger traders

You can get paid for using limit orders as opposed to market orders.

## Tips

Quick wick divergences are not reliable. Divergences formed over longer periods of time signal absorption.

CVD divergences have 2 steps:

1. Possible divergences form
2. Confirmation: Price moves away leaving trapped traders behind and changing market structure.

## Implementation

Look at delta to see if a lot of selling has accumulated at the lows, to indicate they can get trapped.

Multiple positive deltas but price is unable to make a higher high -> bearish.

## Tips

Delta can lead price: Initial CVD divergences do not materialise and price catches up or follows delta.

To solve this context is key. Monitor delta, volume, and rotation times of the range, as well as other tools.

Training and experience are needed to identify CVD divergences.

Recommended for timeframes up to 1h.

There are no hidden divergences, only bullish or bearish.

# Imbalances

Imbalances appear when volume traded at a certain price is no longer balanced.

When a level is out of balance, there are proportionally more buyers or sellers at that level.

Check for imbalances at key support and resistance levels, to differentiate between continuation and possible price reversal.

## Implementation

ATAS
set templates between 400-618%. He has it on 618%.

Context in which imbalances appear and the following reactions can greatly enhance your trading strategy and win rate.

Check for absorption. Limit orders opposite to the imbalances.

Stacked imbalances: 3 or more stacked on top of each other indicating momentum in that move.

## Background

Price will move up until:
No new longs want to open.
or
Longs are overwhelmed by shorts.

Or viceversa.

Overwhelmed = imbalances form.

## Tips

Imbalances are not horizontal to each other, should be viewed diagonally.

Beginning and end of of trends are often marked by market imbalances caused by aggressive market participants.

Absorption and CVD divergences can indicate a possible trend reversal.

Upon breaking an important level, it is important to see imbalances with high volume confirming the move.

If the market does not do what it is supposed to do at a key level, the contrary move is likely to be magnified.

Observe market behaviour after imbalances occur.

# Special case of SFP 

Upon breaking a level, imbalances opposite to the direction of the mode appear -> Possible swift reversal.

1. Stacked imabalances in the wick with large volume, followed by a candle close below/above the reference level.
2. Price reversal continuation with strong opposite imbalance

Best traded when reference level is taken with very high volume but then price retraces with aggressive selling/buying in the opposite direction.

Monitor vol, delta and OI.

# Tips

1. Check for aggressive selling/buying at key level but price not moving psat it -> absorption.
2. Trapped traders and a change in market structure.
3. Aggressive participants entering the market with an increase in volume upon reaching the key level.

no evidence -> no trade!
