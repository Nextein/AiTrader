# Volume

## Utility

Volume is a great metric to confirm trend, trend reversal or original breakout from a range.

Useful to minotr health of trend and check reactions at key levels.

High volume = high liquidity -> can fill orders with low slippage.

## Implementation

Focus onn assets with high trading volume in last 24 hours. specially for altcoins.

Detailed information on volume in ATAS

30 MA on volume.

See if there are volume increases at key levels.

Look at volume in context to understand if key levels are being BROKEN OR REJECTED.

## Tips

Use volume to confirm health of trend and validity of possible breakouts or breakdowns from a range.

Price rising on decreasing volume -> weak uptrend or bearish.
increasing volume -> strong uptrend or bearish.

Spread is difference in order book.

Spread should be as low as possible, indicating good liquidity in asset.

Slippage happens in assets with low liquidity.



# OBV

Following from part one of volume we move on to On Balance Volume (OBV).

OBV was first developed by Joseph Granville. He believed that volume was the driving force behind markets and developed OBV to forecast when major moves would occur based on volume changes.

OBV is an indicator of momentum, measuring changes in volume to determine price direction.

OBV provides more information than the volume histograms typically found at the bottom of the charts.

This particular indicator is a leading one, while some traders will trade on OBV alone, it isn't recommended.

Always support your ideas with additional TA for confluence.

 

Time Stamps

0:36 UTILITY

Provides the running total of trading volume ⇒ volume flow in/out of the trading pair
Useful to monitor the health of a trend.
Useful to estimate a possible break from the range.
 

1:07 IMPLEMENTATION

Default settings on Tradingview.
Monitor OBV as the trend progresses ⇒ volume should follow the trend, check for divergences.
Monitor OBV at the edges of ranges ⇒ volume leads price.
 

1:57 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

 

4:14 TIPS & TRICKS

Leading indicator, powerful with confluence.
Possible to look for patterns in OBV.
Can be used across all time frames ⇒ 4h is the recommended timeframe.
OBV calculations (not needed to implement):
Current OBV = previous OBV + current candle volume (if the current candle closing price is higher than the previous candle).
Current OBV = previous OBV - current candle volume (if current candle closing price is lower than the previous candle)
Current OBV = previous OBV (if current candle closing price equals the previous candle)
 

5:52 TAKE HOME MESSAGE

Monitor the health of a trend, help identify tops/bottoms.
Estimate break from a range.
Powerful leading indicator with other confluence.

## Utility

On Balance Volume provides running total of trading volume: volume flow in/out of pair.

Use to monitor health of trend, or estimate possibele breakout of range.

## Implementation
Default settings

Monitor OBV as trend progresses. Vol should follow trend. Check for divergences.

Monitor OBV at edges of ranges to see if volume leads price and breaks out before price.

## Tips

Classified as a leading indicator showing real data as it comes in and useful to use for confluence.

Possible to look for patterns in OBV itself.

Can be used for all timeframes, but recommended to use on 4h.

# VPVR

Volume Profile Visible Range


Identify volume transacted horizontally.

Confirm ranges with volume.

Useful to define boundaries of continous auction in the market.

row=188
Value Area = 68 or 70

key components: VAL, POC, VAL.
These can be treated as SR levels.

VAH = above fair value -> look for shorts
VAL = below fair value -> look for longs
POC = area with highest volume. Considered fair value.

There are always deviations from these levels. Check market structure and order flow for context at these levels.

POC can be used as TP1 area for trades taken at VAH/VAL.

Price performs rotations around POC from VAH to VAL and back. A change in speed or momentum of rotation within the range can indicate follow through.

## Tips

2 types of auction:

1. Ranging: 80% of the time. sideways price.
2. Trending: 20% of the time. a series of ranges breaking upwards or downwards continuously.

Important to realise profits, specially when trading ranges.

## Tips

When trading ranges, context is important. Don't trade robotically from high to low and vicecversa.

HTF ranges are stronger.

Traders that are caught offisde often exit at break even, causing reactions at the key levels of the range.

Important to mointor order flow, including, volume, OI and delta as range processes. Specially at key areas of range.

Measure speed of rotations within the range to gage momentum and check for divergences as range goes one.

# Fixed Range

VPVR applied to specific areas of the chart.

Confirm ranges with volume and define boundaires for auctioning process. Can find untested/naked POCs in past price history that might become relevant when revisited.

row: 148
value area volume = 68 or 70

key components: VAH, VAL, POC. Treat as SR levels.

Look at volume of range without including the volume necessary to enter and the volume encessary to exit the range.

## Tips

Powerful, advanced, and better than the VPVR.

Helps define untested ranges and nakes POCs that can provide strong reaction on first touch.

Price will often reject/bounce at POC upon re-entering the range. POC is most likely SR area, based of course on market context.

Look at context and search for confluence.

Usefull on all timeframes, easier on HTF.



# Session Volume & Naked POC

## Utility

Volume Profile Session Volume tool: shows key areas of each session and previous week.

VAL, VAH, POC are important SR levels for day traders, and they should be mapped out as part of the daily routine.

nPOCs are main focus for swing traders


## Implementation
row size = 148
value area volume = 70

extend POC to the right

nPOCs are untapped POC from previous sessions

Generally expect a strong reaction when a nPOC is approached. Confluence is key.

## Tips


If price claims VAH of a range, forms a distribution pattern, and then falls back into the range, losing the VAH support, there is an 80% of it going to the low of the range.

and viceversa.

naked = untapped since price broke away from POC. Great majority of tradesr who entered positions at the POC but guesses the direction wrong, would like to exit at breakeven, causing a strong first reaction when revisited together with the traders who also enter expecting this reaction.

Possible trade setup:

nPOC and CC confluence.

You can pre-set limit orders here, but setting alerts is better.

VAL, VAH, POC are useful specially for intra-day traders as SR.


80% chance of range rotation upon leaving and re-entering a range.
