# Daily Trading Routine

Be prepared for the day ahead.

Choose the assets you want to trade.

Have my plan.

Know the setup I'm going to take before the setup is there.

Mark out KEY levels.

PLAN all possible trade setups. Bullish and bearish setup.

I'm prepared for anything that happens.

Take the trade that 'comes to me'.

NOt taking a trade is a trade in  itself.

## Implementation

daily sheets.

I have all my key reference levels and know which setups I will take to be PREPARED for them before they are visible.

### Context

Do in the morning to understand base structure for the day.

KEEP IT SIMPLE. Avoid analysis paralysis.

Too much theory leads to not knowing what setups to take.

Plans in the morning to get ready. Plan setups.

1. Trend direction: Sideways or trending. 15m - 1h to check current local situation. 1d timeframe to look at overall trend.

Sideways or trending.

Taking profits early or trailing SL depends on context.

2. HTF Elliot Wave count.

Aggressive when in a wave 3.
In wave 4 he will be much more conservative, entries near lows/highs, taking profits.

3. CVD divergences.

Daily bias is helpful.

### Important levels

important levels within the day.

- CC FIbonacci. Global (1d, 1w levels) and local (local lows to local highs).
- 4h 55 200 EMAs. They're the most respected levels,
- POCs: Daily, Weekly, Monthly. Look to trade off of these levels.

### Key horizontal levels
- Our BIGGEST trading levels. Determined by several levels of confluence.

If I give you a key level and they are broken, expect them to flip.

Massive SR levels created through several confluence  factors.

You generally focus on the next level of resistance and next level of support that you will trade off of.

### Volume Information

Look at statistics.

- Open Interest (of previous day).
- Daily Volume and Delta (previous day).
- Funding: bullish or bearish?

Daily record what the open interest is, volume and delta.

Are volume and delta increasing?

### Opens and notes

Opens is a new section he is added.

Many different strategies for this, he will share his for the daily open and weekly open strategy.

- Daily, weekly and monthly opens.
- What we are trading / looking to trade.
- Key notes for the day ahead.


Do this preparation to gain the edge over the competition.

We will do this every single day to be successful.

It takes 25 minutes in the morning before London open.

Wake up 45 minutes before london open.

Before market has even open, we already know where we want to trade.

Looking at the chart 10h a day won't make you a good trader. Analysis paralysis.

Just take the trade, record it, and analyse performance over time.

Once everything is planned, we set alerts at our trade levels and sit back.

When the alert is hit, he takes 1 second to execute.

example: 25minutes of planning, hours/days of nothing, 1 second of executing. 5 minutes to review volume, orderflow, etc to confirm he wants to trade.
