# Compounding

Add to trades on the way up at SR flips (for example).

New trade must be good trade on its own that you would take if you were not already in the trade.

Compounding allows winners to run.

Only compound IF a new setup appears. If you weren't in a trade, would you take that trade? If so, you can enter the trade and compound your position. Your SL is moved to the SL of the new trade setup, thus trailing the previous SLs.

# Averaging down

Advanced technique to implement. Not for beginners.

Add to the position as it moves against you.

When doing this he likes to close the trade at breakeven. Remove the stress, analyse why the first setup didn't work out.

Have a hard limit of how many times we are going to average down before accepting loss.

His average down position sizing tends to be to enter the second setup with twice the size of the first position.

You shouldn't be doing this too much, only when something goes wrong sort of.

# Laddering

He's doing this on every single trade. 

Don't place one buy order, but split it into multiple orders.

We cannot predict the exact low or high, which is why laddering is so important.

Orders can be waited towards the top or towards the bottom.
