A basic, yet overlooked area of analysis in trading is most definitely support and resistance in reference to price action.

At least 90% of traders lose money, and one reason is that they don't know how to identify support and resistance levels. More importantly, they don't even know that support and resistance levels exist.

This video will take you through a full demonstration of how and where to identify support and resistance levels on a chart.

Support and resistance levels are essential to a winning trading routine.

### Utility

SR are fundamentals of trading.

Basic but strongest and best tools to use.

Use every day.

### Implementation

Start on HTF and work your way down marking out levels.

Trend lines need 2 touches to be created.

After the 2 touches the line is speculative, after the 3rd touch it is a confirmed trendline.

Marking levels wrong will lose money. How they're marked is 'set in stone'.

Trend lines are slightly harder, he would follow Eliott Wave thory for using trend lines mos of the time.

The more times a level is tested, the weaker it gets.

### Implementation

Mark out HTF MOnthly: red M close followed by green M close.

Stocks the close and open don't line up. Use lowest/highest of the two for SR lines.

### Tips

Hide all TA with levels that are not close by. Keeps the chart clean.

Alt+I Can help change a Bias.

Mastering TradingView is a requirement to trading.

# Support & Resistance Flips

## Utility

SR lines are some of thes strongest lines in trading.

Simple theory, very effective in practice.

A support line when broken to the downside becomes resistance, and viceverse.

Look for backtests of the original SR flips for confirmation.


If backtested and lost, this can be a failed auction trade setup.


## Implementation

Trend lines when broken are an early signal of a total trend reverstal (Elliot Wave theory).

Trend lines are used for patterns such as triangles, once a triangle is broken, price should not come back into that triangle, it should flip.

SR Flips can happen on other levels from other tools (fibs, etc).

If we see extended consolidadtion at a resistance before a breakout  then we are more likely to see that level flip.

Spending only a minute at the resistance before breaking it will make it less likely to hold.

Confluence is really important when looking to trade a flip.

No confluence, no trade. You want to see 3+ levels of confluence.

## Tips

Look for FA when SR fails after a breakout.

Upon breaking a level, use Orderflow to check volume and delta statistics.

We want high volume and high delta and increase in OI on breakout.
