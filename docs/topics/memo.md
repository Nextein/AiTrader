# Trading Psychology

## Introduction

Trading emotinos can betray us and need to be handled.

- fear : leads to hesitation and inability to let trade develop according to plan. Usually happens when size of trade is too large or inadequate.#

- Depression: lead to decrease in confidence, or doubt your own abilities and technical analysis. Can occur after a losing streak. Sometimes you feel like quitting trading altogether.

- Greed: can epress itself in un2willingness to realise profits and instead hope for more profits.

- Euphoria: feeling of invincibility after very successful trades. Leads to complacency, being overconfident and poor risk management.

To keep emotions under control, attempt to get in the zone.

- Organised traading station.
- No distractions.
- Full focus
- Beware of outside negativity. This can impat your trading performance.

Risk management is the key component to longevity in trading. We recommend that you follow these rules:

1. Protect your capital: Proper planning will reduce your fear of trade execution as you will always know how mnuch capital you can lose on your next trade.

2. Stick to your plan. Ignore external distractions or suggestions and always know where YOUR invalidation is for YOUR trade setup.
3. No trade is also a trade. You should only take the best trade setups that meet your strict criteria, and enver chase or force a trade.

4. Use leverage sensibly. With increased leverage and position size comes increased risk.

Benefitial steps you should take before each trade:

1. Find the confluence. This will greatly improve probabilities for your trades. It's hard work but it's definitely worth it.
2. Pick a position size that fits your account size. This will help eliminate the emotions that can betray you such as fear, depression, greed and euphoria, as your maximum possible loss and your possible realised profits are already precalculated.

3. After first 2 steps, execute the trtade. Without any feelings or doubts.

Tips & Tricks:

- To become consistently profitable trader over time, we recommend you focus mentally & Physically. Exercies, eat healthy, sleep well to increase trading performance.

- Take trading seriously. Treat it like a job or busniess.

- Patience is key when waiting for trade setups.

Be aware of your emotions when trading!

## Mindset and Emotions

1. How to recognise problems in your trading mindset: ask questions:

- Do you second-guess yourself when entering trades and doubt your own analysis?
- Do you overthink trade setup due to recent losses?
- Do you have a plan for your trade? Are you sticking to your plan?

Disruptive emotions caused by current situation can also be causing you problems:

- Pressure: Have to make money from trading to support yourself & family.
- You compare yourself to others and their success (additional pressure).
- Tensions from participating in market and putting your capital at risk.

2. For a correct mindste we must also understand & accept risk. Traders often accept that they can lose but do not truly accept risk, refuse to take a loss, and let theur losing trades grow larger and larger.

You can lose any trade you take. All it takes is one other person to invalidate it.

It is important that you embrace that you'retrading probabilities and not certainties.

3. Trading strategy development. We recommend you follow these 4 steps:

    1. Work through the learning content.
    2. Decide on a setup that you will take for the next 25 trades. Establish a very strict rule set & always take the setup when the criteria are met.
    3. Use only $1 on each trade & record each trade result.
    4. After 25 trades (not before), check results and if necessary, make adjustments.

4. Secret to trading: "no man ever reached to excellence in any one art or profession without having passed through the slow and painful process of preparation." - Quintus Horatius Flaccus.

You must put in the hard work.

There is no way of avoiding all loses in trading. #No indicators change that.

You should strive to trade without fear or overconfidence.

A key concept to embrace in order to successfully transform your trading mindset is one championed by Mark Douglas: You will never know if your next trade will be a winner or a loser, only the probabilities of a large set of trades can be ion your favour if you have an edge.

Stoop overthinking trade setups and think in a "percentage over a series of trades" perspective.

The goal is consistency over a large period of time (10 years).

In order to improve trading mindset you need to recognise the problems in yourself.

## Psychology in Trading

In order to develop the right trading mindset you must ask yourself:

- Do you really enjoy the act of trading? or do you suffer from fear and greed every minute that you-re in the market? If yes, you don't understand market and/or yourself.
 
- As Mark Douglas used to say, most traders win or lose to the same degree that they understand themselves.

World-class professional traders see the marketa as a support mechanism which they can use to increase their capital.

Amateurs and less successful traders see the market as a threatening.

In the end, it is important to lose the fear of losing money, as it is a very normal part of trading. Scared money does not make money.

As you progress in your trading career, you will realise that there is a difference between being in the zone and connected with the market and not being in that state of mind. Professional traders are able to block out emotions when entering & exiting trades and they simply strictly follow their plan with predefined risk. They feel a connection with the market and they can almost anticipate what is going to happen next. In this state of mind trading becomes effortless, and some describe it as "knowing without knowing how I know".

Taking responsibility for your trades is a key principle in becoming a consistent and profitable trader. For every win & loss that you take there is only one responsible person, and that is yourself. A trading journal is an ecellent tool for keeping accountability and monitoring those wins and losses. It is important that you learn from these losses and analyse what went wrong.


## More notes on psychology

- Greed: Try and make more profits than planned
- Fear:
    - Overleveraged: more lostt incurred even whem trade is going according to structure.
    - Hold losses longer.
    - Cut winners short.

Money won't come until you focus on the process and not the money.

Risk less at start (0.25%), increase after hitting 3% (to 1%). This way you aren't psychologically affected by starting at a loss.

You don't have to trade every day. Observe this and yourself.

If you identify a mistake, fear or greed, CLOSE TRADE IMMEDIATELY. Removing these stresses is more important than PNL. We can't control the market, but we can control out emotions.

Set realistic PNL targets based on structure. These targets can only be hit holding a trade for months (letting runners run), not overnight.

Develop strategies to cope with losses:

- Realistic long term view.Compare with day-to-day job, that is good enough.
- Diversifiation. Key in life, not just trading.
- Revise trading strategy after every X trades.
    - Analyse losses: 
        - What I did wrong.
        - Thought process.
        - Did I follo strategy?
    - Hold yourself accountable.
- Handle stress & pressure:
    - Financially
    - Emotionally#- With family members

Trading to make life easier, not more stressful.

Stress leads to overtrading, impulsive decision after losses due to very high stress.

To manage stress:

- Eat healthy.
- Regular exercise.
- Good sleep (Necessary for good thinking).
- Mindfulness exercises: Meditation & Praying.

If stressed before entering a trade, don't trade. Stop for the day.

Manage life stresses before trading.

Choose a plan and strategy based on your personality and how your brain processes when looking at a chart.

We aim to be a trader long term, not making a profit. We want to still be traders in 3 years.

If you don't lose in a day, that is a WIN.
Having control when taking a loss is a WIN.

# Hedging

See trading as a business.

- Long=-term view
- Protect assets
- Manage assets with due dilligence

Use leverage so portion of online assets protects entire offline portfolio.

Hedge trades are treated very differently to standard trades from a PNL perspective.
- Happily hold for longer.
- Only close on:
    - Big sign of strengh against.
    - SL hit.

On the contrary, normal trades are always entered with a target in mind. Buy always with an idea of selling.

When in a hedge short, you'll feel much more comfortable entering long trades in a downtrend.

If he takes 2.5% off and moves SL to entry on hedge short, and price drops lower, he will scale in to get hedge short back to 1:1 with portfolio to protect entire portfolio.

Entere leveraged long on hedged short TP using generated profits with SL at entry as quick as possible => allows for hedged position to now increase to bigger position size.

# Funded Accounts

Criteria to consider when selecting a firm:

- Profit Sharing
- Account growth opportunities
- Tools offered
- Trading Platform
- Firm's Reuptation

# Volume

Volume ¡ ç contracts bought / sold added together.

Only trade a coin with 200+ 24h BTC volume
To filter coins in Binance, go to markets, sort by 24h volume.

Could also sort by 24h change and choose those that are very green too. Avoid coins with large spreads.

Volume is important because of liquidity. You need liquidity to trade.

If you regularly trade an asset you should know the average spread of the coin.

He likes to trade against crypto, not agains fiat or stablecoins. With large capital you want to place iceberg orders and hide or disguise them. You don´t want your order to be obvious.

Volume is a great way of confirminf a trend, trend reversal, and its original breakout.

Volume is not so readily available. Use these sites:
- tradinglite.com
- exocharts.com
- coinfarm.online
- aggr.trade
- tensorcharts.com
- hyblockcapital.com/older
- hyperliquid

## Volume confirming trend:

Volume increases as price goes up. Use a 30 MA on volume to see if it's on average increasing or decreasing.
Volume declines on pullbacks.

Breakout with high volume is a cionfirmed breakout.
Breakout with low volume is probably a fakeout.

price       |       Volume      |       Market
Rising      |       Increasing  |       Strong uptrend -> Bullish
Rising      |       Declining  |       Weak uptrend -> Bullish
Declining      |       Increasing  |       Strong downtrend -> Bullish
Declining      |       Declining  |       Weak downtrend -> Bullish


## SR Flip Strategy

1. Breakout with high volume
2. Pullback with low volume
3. Retest with high volume


## OBV (On-Balance-Volume)

Volume indicates whether moves are healthy or not.

Volume leads price many times. OBV is a leading indicators, meaning it can give false signals.

OBV breaks SR lines before price does. You can use it to dictate market tops, for confirmation on breakouts, for determining in which direction price is going to breakout of a range (the OBV breaks out of the range first).

OBV divergences:
- Price and OBV making higher highs = trend confirmation. New money entering the market combined with Open Interest confirms trend.
- Price makes higher lows but OBV doesn't, this is a bearish divergence.

OBV leading price:
- Price moves sideways but OBV is moving down heavily -> price is going to drop.

If I'm trend following, OBV must be confirming trend.

Compare OBV with wicks in ranges and closes in trends.

## Priorities:

1. Horizontals
2. Fibonacci
3. Volume

## VPVR - Volum Profile Volume Range

Price remains longer range-bound than trending. We need to know how to trade ranges. Price will remain most of the time at a fair price until there is an imbalance in buyers and sellers.

Raning market happens 80% of the time. That's why it's important to take profits, to avoid seeing price go back to entry and lose profits. Taking profits is SO IMPORTANT! Don't let winning trades turn to losing trades.

A trending market is a rangin market that continuously breaks in the same direction.

Massive increase in buy volume at an over-extended move means there is likely to be a top. Everyone FOMO'ed in and bought, ther eis no one left to buy.

VPVR - row size 188. Value area volume: 68.
POC is big SR level.

He considers big spikes in 1m candles anomalies and doesn't take it in consideration.

VPVR has 3 main components:
- VAH - Value Area High
- POC - Point Of Control
- VAL - Value Area Low

Don't just look at patterns, understand them in the context of what is happening in the chart.

When trading a range, observe:

1. Buying/Selling Climax: high volume at start of the range, all buyers are in. You could see CVD divergences, in which case you are very likely to form a range. An SFP after this, failing to move further, means you're probably at the start of a range.

2. Big buy volume at POC coming from top of the range: possible sign of a breakout towards the upside.

3. Breakout: if it isn't a higher volume than the spike volumes in the range, it's not the strongest breakout. The average volume spike in the range must be lower than the breakout volume.

POC is generally where one would not enter a trade because you would be entering at fair value. At VAH we are above fair value, where where we should be taking shorts. Vice versa for VAL.
Enter at VAL/VAH and take profits at middle of the range (POC). Never beat yourself up for taking profits. Also move SL to entry.

If you short at VAH and price closes above VAH, price is being "accepted" outisde of this range and we should look to close our shorts from the VAH because people are starting to value the asset higher and the VAH is no longer considered above fair price.

Trading a range robotically is guaranteed to end in a losing trade when it breaks out, but that is ok. That is why risk management is so important.

Factors to consider:

1. How long it takes to move from VAL to VAH & VAH to VAL.
2. Delta chart.
3. OBV can alsso breakout before price does and give us a heads up.

If price is starting to take less time to omve up to VAH and delta is increasing, there is an increase in buying pressure and you can get a heads up of when and in what direction price is likely to breakout.

When SR of reange (parallel channel) don't align with VAH and VAL, consider the support + VAL a support area and resitance + VAH a resistance area.

Parallel channels aren't drawn based on VPVR, they must be drawn based on market structure.

Acceptance above/below VAH/VAL WITH VOLUME indicates a breakout in that direction.

Highs and lows of range are usually characterised by spikes in volume.

1:1 fib extensions are clear signs of a correction happening at that level.

## Fixed Range

Very similar to VPVR.
Favourit tool.

Helpful when looking at an untested range, to figure out the most likely point within that range where price is going to be rejected.

POC is where most value what transacted. Most people will trade at the POC. When price breaks to upside/downside, when it retraecs back to POC, those who were underwater (most volume) will want to exit at breakeven and therefore they create a SR level.

Fixed range can be applie to all timeframes. It's easier on higher (+H4) timeframes.

The more you touch a level (like POC), the weaker it becomes. First touch of a level and rejection is the strongest, following touches are weaker.

Fixed range settings: row size: 148. Value area volume: 68.

You never want to place limit orders at POCs. To enter at that price there must be other confluences. Do set limit orders if POC has confluence with another major level.

## Naked POC

untested POC.

Very strong level. Double the strength on next retest because it as all the traders still trapped in waiting to exit on breakeven.

## Session Volume

On smaller timeframes, look at session's volume, POC, VAL and VAL.

Draw fixed range for previous day to find good SR levels.

Great trades setup: nPOC inside a fib CC. Great entry point after retracement.

If price is accepted above VAH and it comes back into the value area and is accepted below the VAH, it is very likely it will make it's way down to the VAL.


# Indicators

## Open interest & Funding

Great to track macro trend, monitor health of trend, detect possible loss in momentum, and upcoming trend reversal.

Funding can influence price. Good to track.

Monitor increase/decrease in OI to track money entering or leaving the asset.

OI can be tracked on all timeframes.

When OI increases with price: the uptrend is healthy. Important to keep market context in consideration and look at other metrics such as volume, delta & CVD divergences.

Funding helps identify a crowded trade. Extreme funding rates means there is a significant mismatch between longs and shorts.

Price increases     |   Volume & OI increase    |   bullish   |  strong uptrend
Price increases     |   Volume & OI decrease    |   bearish   |  weak uptrend
Price decreases     |   Volume & OI increase    |   bearish   |  strong downtrend
Price decreases     |   Volume & OI decrease    |   bullish   |  weak downtrend

Postive funding: longs pay shorts.
Negative funding: shorts pay longs.

Funding encourages traders to open long/short positions when price differs a lot. It helps keeps derivatives price close to spot price.

> +-0.075% = extreme
< +-0.075% = neutral

Context is crucial when using these metrics.

## VWAP

Combines price and volume.

Used on all timeframes as dynamic SR.

Session VWAP is great for scalping (ie 15m).

Use anchored VWAP in confluence with Fib, POC, VAH/VAL, and other major levels.

Use rejections on VWAP in a downtrend to enter shorts. Use with other confluences.

Expect strong reaction on higher timeframe VWAP on first touch.

Good confluences:

- VWAP + CC
- VWAP + POC
- VWAP + VAH/VAL

## Best divergence setup

In an uptrend, when price forms a higher low and an indicator forms a lower low, this is a great opportunity to buy the dip.
